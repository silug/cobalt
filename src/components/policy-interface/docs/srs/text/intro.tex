\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
This Software Requirements Specification provides a complete
description of all the \textbf{Cobalt-FTB Policy Definition \&
  Execution System}.

\subsection{Intended Audience}
The intended audience of this document are developers of the
\emph{Cobalt Resource Manager}, the \emph{Coordinated Infrastructure
  for Fault Tolerant Systems(CIFTS) / Fault Tolerance Backplane(FTB)}.

\subsection{Project Scope}
The CPDES is a system that enables system administrators and
developers of FTB-enabled components, on leadership machines, to write
policies for fault tolerance and recovery using the \emph{Fault
  Tolerance Backplane} infrastructure. The system also interacts with
the machine's resource manager to collect system related data and
carry out policy based actions based on system policy definitions.

The system also defines message naming conventions for use of the said
components.
